## Code Contribution
* Consider asking if your change is wanted before starting to work on it or making a pull request.
* Please try to keep the code clean and follow the existing formatting. Use ESLint.
* This project aims to remain simple. I'm not interested in adding frameworks or large libraries unless it is really necessary.
* You need a web server that serves the root of this project. You may need HTTPS with a trusted certificate if the service worker doesn't work. Check out [local-web-server](https://github.com/lwsjs/local-web-server).
* Feel free to contact me on Discord about this. (`@blueyescat`)

### After Finishing Development
1. Test your changes on multiple browsers to ensure they work and don't break any existing functionality.
2. Create a [pull request](https://github.com/Blueyescat/dsatools/pulls) targeting the `dev` branch.
