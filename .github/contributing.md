### Things to Know
* To run the website in local, you will need a web server serving a directory (web server root directory) containing the root of this repository.
For example, it should serve `GitHub/` for `GitHub/dsatools/` then you can access it at `//localhost:port/dsatools/`.
The paths in the website are made in a way working properly with GitHub Pages.
With this setup, there won't be any difference between the published page and your local project.

  A web server is also needed for web workers to work on browsers.
* Use ESLint with the config already in the repository. Try and keep the code clean, follow the existing formatting.
  * I'm okay with fixing formatting issues after your pull request.
* This project is meant to be kept simple. I'm not willing to add frameworks, big libraries and such.
* You can have your credit at the bottom of the tool page.
* Feel free to contact me on Discord about this! `Blueyescat#0733`
